Description: This is a demo chatbot module. It tags short texts using the following tags:
        1.	Lang: English
        2.	Lang: German
        3.	Company Structure: Ltd.
        4.	Company Structure: plc
        5.	Shareholder
        
        The solution is unit-tested and the code style complies with PEP-8 standards.
        
        # Requirements
        * Python 3.6 (Tensorflow do not support 3.7 on Windows.)
        * Tested only on Windows 10.
        
        # Installation
        
        The module can be installed using the following command:
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/szedjani/chatbot-demo.git`
        
        # Usage
        
        ```python
        import chatbot_demo
        tagger = Tagger()
        print(tagger.tag("Can I be shareholder of a limited company?"))
        ```
        
        It would print `[1,3,5]`
        
        # Development
        
        First install the modules `Rasa` and `langdetect` (pip would install them automatically), then clone the project.
        
        # Evaluation
        
        The solution correctly tags all given test sentences (you can find them in `test.py`). However, further development would require more test data.
